# steamSales
Scraper and Mongo DB

go pull from steam all the sales on their main page
need to determine if the sale has already been pulled or if its no longer in effect

would like to go deeper and pull out the current community rating of that game (maybe pull in the top 5 reviews)

maybe go find the game on other websites to find what their price is?
